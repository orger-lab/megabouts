Welcome to Megabouts' documentation!
====================================
Accurate measurements of animal behavior are crucial for neuroscience, as well as genetic and pharmacological screening. Megabouts is a Python toolbox designed to precisely quantify zebrafish larval locomotion.
Our software supports locomotion analysis in both freely swimming and head-restrained conditions, 
with the goal of promoting standardized zebrafish locomotion studies across neuroscience, pharmacology, and genetics.

For more details, please check `our paper on bioRxiv <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.14.613078v1>`_.

Please support the development of Megabouts by starring and/or watching the project on Github_!


.. note::
   Megabouts is under active development and might include breaking changes
   between versions. If you use Megabouts in your work, we recommend double-checking
   your current version.
