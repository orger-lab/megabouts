Welcome to Megabouts' documentation!
====================================

Accurate measurements of behavior are crucial to understanding animal physiology. 
Megabouts allows to quantify zebrafish larvae locomotion. 
This open-source Python toolbox handles locomotion in both freely swimming and head-restrained conditions and aims to promote standardized zebrafish locomotion analysis across neuroscience, pharmacology, and genetics.
For more details, check `our paper on bioRxiv <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.14.613078v1>`_

Please support the development of Megabouts by starring and/or watching the project on Github_!


.. note::
   Megabouts is under active development and might include breaking changes
   between versions. If you use Megabouts in your work, we recommend to double check
   your current version.
